Problem Statement:
The market for supply chain analytics is expected to develop at a CAGR of 17.3 percent
from 2019 to 2024, more than doubling in size. This data demonstrates how supply
chain organizations are understanding the advantages of being able to predict what will
happen in the future with a decent degree of certainty. Supply chain leaders may use
this data to address supply chain difficulties, cut costs, and enhance service levels all at
the same time.

The main goal is to predict the supply chain shipping pricing based on the available
factors in the dataset.

Approach: The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms that’s best fit for the above case.

•Created End-to-End Machine Learning Regression Training Pipeline including steps such as Data ingestion from database, Data Validation, Data Transformation, Training the model for incoming data , Evaluating the model on incoming data and finally pushing the best model for deployment.

•ML Algorithms used: KNN Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Adaboost Regressor, XGB Regressor, Voting Regressor

•Evaluation metrics used for model performance: r2 score
